# MESA Bootcamp 2023 Machine Learning Notebook

Machine Learning is being applied to many applications in science and technology. In this tutorial, we will 

* Introduce the basis concepts of machine learning, 
* Run through some examples of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and finally 
* Apply machine learning to various real-world applications. 

## What is the aim of this workshop

This workshop is designed to give you some hands-on experience with machine learning with examples that you can try and play around with. 

Feel free to modify the code, add and remove code, and copy the code for you own applications. 

## How to use these notebooks

These notebooks are run in Google Colab, which works like Microsoft Word but you can also perform computer programs with them. We will be using a computer program called Python to analyse nanoparticles. 

Before beginning, make sure you have a google account. If you do not have a google account, [click here to set up a new Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)

To begin, first click on the *Open in Colab* button below. This will open a notebook in Google Colab, and will tell you what to do next! Google Colabs only run on a website. **Google Colab will not be installed on your computer and will not install anything on your computer.** 

**Note: When you click the *Open in Colab* button, you may be ask that you need allow access to "Google Colab".** If asked, allow Google Colabs to work with your Google Account.

Have fun!
