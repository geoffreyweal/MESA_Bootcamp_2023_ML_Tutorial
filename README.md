# MESA Bootcamp 2023 Machine Learning Notebook

Machine Learning is being applied to many applications in science and technology. In this tutorial, we will 

* Introduce the basis concepts of machine learning, 
* Run through some examples of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and finally 
* Apply machine learning to various real-world applications. 

## What is the aim of this workshop

This workshop is designed to give you some hands-on experience with machine learning with examples that you can try and play around with. 

Feel free to modify the code, add and remove code, and copy the code for you own applications. 

## Do I need any computer programming experience

No

Some Python skills will help, but you should be able to complete this tutorial without prior Python or computer programming experience.

This tutorial is designed to reduce the "cost of entry" to doing machine learning. All the code is given, with options to modifying the code to try other machine learning algorithms given as well.

In the final notebook, you are given a section where you can copy code you have used in Parts 2, 3, and 4 to practise copying and writing machine learning in python if you would like a challenge!


## How to use these notebooks

These notebooks are run in Google Colab, which works like Microsoft Word but you can also perform computer programs with them. We will be using a computer program called Python to analyse nanoparticles. 

Before beginning, make sure you have a google account. If you do not have a google account, [click here to set up a new Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)

To begin, first click on the *Open in Colab* button below. This will open a notebook in Google Colab, and will tell you what to do next! Google Colabs only run on a website. **Google Colab will not be installed on your computer and will not install anything on your computer.** 

**Note: When you click the *Open in Colab* button, you may be ask that you need allow access to "Google Colab".** If asked, allow Google Colabs to work with your Google Account.

Have fun!
