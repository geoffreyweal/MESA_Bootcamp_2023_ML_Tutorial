It has been built by hundreds of contributors from around the world, and is used across industry and academia.\n","\n","Scikit-Learn is built upon Python's [NumPy (Numerical Python)](http://numpy.org) and [SciPy (Scientific Python)](http://scipy.org) libraries, which enable efficient in-core numerical and scientific computation within Python. As such, scikit-learn is not specifically designed for extremely large datasets, though there is [some work](https://github.com/ogrisel/parallel_ml_tutorial) in this area."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZXDrGRD-y0JR"},"source":["## What is Machine Learning?\n","\n","In this section we will begin to explore the basic principles of machine learning.\n","Machine Learning is about building programs with **tunable parameters** (typically an\n","array of floating point values) that are adjusted automatically so as to improve\n","their behavior by **adapting to previously seen data.**\n","\n","Machine Learning can be considered a subfield of **artificial Intelligence** since those\n","algorithms can be seen as building blocks to make computers learn to behave more\n","intelligently by somehow **generalizing** rather that just storing and retrieving data items\n","like a database system would do."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wgBRww5-y0JS"},"source":["## Representation of Data in Scikit-learn\n","\n","Machine learning is about creating models from data: for that reason, we'll start by\n","discussing how data can be represented in order to be understood by the computer.  Along\n","with this, we'll build on our matplotlib examples from the previous section and show some\n","examples of how to visualize data.\n","\n","Most machine learning algorithms implemented in scikit-learn expect data to be stored in a\n","**two-dimensional array or matrix**.  The arrays can be\n","either ``numpy`` arrays, or in some cases ``scipy.sparse`` matrices.\n","The size of the array is expected to be `[n_samples, n_features]`\n","\n","- **n_samples:**   The number of samples: each sample is an item to process (e.g. classify).\n","  A sample can be a document, a picture, a sound, a video, an astronomical object,\n","  a row in database or CSV file,\n","  or whatever you can describe with a fixed set of quantitative traits.\n","- **n_features:**  The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each\n","  item in a quantitative manner.  Features are generally real-valued, but may be boolean or\n","  discrete-valued in some cases.\n","\n","The number of features must be fixed in advance. However it can be very high dimensional\n","(e.g. millions of features) with most of them being zeros for a given sample. This is a case\n","where `scipy.sparse` matrices can be useful, in that they are\n","much more memory-efficient than numpy arrays."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Y5hHX69Hy0JT"},"source":["<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img src=\"https://github.com/geoffreyweal/MESA_Bootcamp_ML_Tutorial/blob/main/Notebooks/images/data-layout.png?raw=true\" width=\"600\"/>\n","</p>\n","\n","(Figure from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook))"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"orig_nbformat":4,"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
